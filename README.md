script5.ts  --- The SORT() solution
Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (orcompSame(a, b)) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities (the multiplicity of a member is the number of times it appears). "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order.

Examples
Valid arrays
a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]  
b = [121, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
comp(a, b) returns true because in b 121 is the square of 11, 14641 is the square of 121, 20736 the square of 144, 361 the square of 19, 25921 the square of 161, and so on. It gets obvious if we write b's elements in terms of squares:

a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11] 
b = [11*11, 121*121, 144*144, 19*19, 161*161, 19*19, 144*144, 19*19]
Invalid arrays
If, for example, we change the first number to something else, comp is not returning true anymore:

a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]  
b = [132, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
comp(a,b) returns false because in b 132 is not the square of any number of a.

a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]  
b = [121, 14641, 20736, 36100, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
comp(a,b) returns false because in b 36100 is not the square of any number of a.

Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.

As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(

So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with [1, 1, 1] as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:

[1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]
But what if we started with [0, 0, 1] as a signature? As starting with [0, 1] instead of [1, 1] basically shifts the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:

[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]
Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence.

Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if n == 0, then return an empty array (except in C return NULL) and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)

If you enjoyed this kata more advanced and generalized version of it can be found in the Xbonacci kata

[Personal thanks to Professor Jim Fowler on Coursera for his awesome classes that I really recommend to any math enthusiast and for showing me this mathematical curiosity too with his usual contagious passion :)]

n this kata, you should calculate type of triangle with three given sides a, b and c (given in any order).

If all angles are less than 90°, this triangle is acute and function should return 1.

If one angle is strictly 90°, this triangle is right and function should return 2.

If one angle more than 90°, this triangle is obtuse and function should return 3.

If three sides cannot form triangle, or one angle is 180° (which turns triangle into segment) - function should return 0.

Input parameters are sides of given triangle. All input values are non-negative floating point or integer numbers (or both).

Acute

Right

Obtuse

Examples:
triangleType(2, 4, 6); // return 0 (Not triangle)
triangleType(8, 5, 7); // return 1 (Acute, angles are approx. 82°, 38° and 60°)
triangleType(3, 4, 5); // return 2 (Right, angles are approx. 37°, 53° and exactly 90°)
triangleType(7, 12, 8); // return 3 (Obtuse, angles are approx. 34°, 106° and 40°)
If you stuck, this can help you: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines. But you can solve this kata even without angle calculation.

There is very small chance of random test to fail due to round-off error, in such case resubmit your solution.

You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

[]                                -->  "no one likes this"
["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
["Jacob", "Alex"]                 -->  "Jacob and Alex like this"
["Max", "John", "Mark"]           -->  "Max, John and Mark like this"
["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"

Note: For 4 or more names, the number in "and 2 others" simply increases.

Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

Example
createPhoneNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) // => returns "(123) 456-7890"
The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.

Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

Examples
[7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).

Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

Examples
    16  -->  1 + 6 = 7
   942  -->  9 + 4 + 2 = 15  -->  1 + 5 = 6
132189  -->  1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24  -->  2 + 4 = 6
493193  -->  4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29  -->  2 + 9 = 11  -->  1 + 1 = 2

Don't give me five!
In this kata you get the start number and the end number of a region and should return the count of all numbers except numbers with a 5 in it. The start and the end number are both inclusive!

Examples:

1,9 -> 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 -> Result 8
4,17 -> 4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 -> Result 12
The result may contain fives. ;-)
The start number will always be smaller than the end number. Both numbers can be also negative!

I'm very curious for your solutions and the way you solve it. Maybe someone of you will find an easy pure mathematics solution.

Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)

I have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata!

Linked Lists - Get Nth
Implement a GetNth() function that takes a linked list and an integer index and returns the node stored at the Nth index position. GetNth() uses the C numbering convention that the first node is index 0, the second is index 1, ... and so on.

So for the list 42 -> 13 -> 666, GetNth(1) should return Node(13);

getNth(1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null, 0).data === 1
getNth(1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null, 1).data === 2
The index should be in the range [0..length-1]. If it is not, or if the list is empty, GetNth() should throw/raise an exception (ArgumentException in C#, InvalidArgumentException in PHP, Exception in Java).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
script15.ts
You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.

For example:

Let's say you are given the array {1,2,3,4,3,2,1}:
Your function will return the index 3, because at the 3rd position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1,2,3}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({3,2,1}) both equal 6.

Let's look at another one.
You are given the array {1,100,50,-51,1,1}:
Your function will return the index 1, because at the 1st position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({50,-51,1,1}) both equal 1.

Last one:
You are given the array {20,10,-80,10,10,15,35}
At index 0 the left side is {}
The right side is {10,-80,10,10,15,35}
They both are equal to 0 when added. (Empty arrays are equal to 0 in this problem)
Index 0 is the place where the left side and right side are equal.

Note: Please remember that in most programming/scripting languages the index of an array starts at 0.

Input:
An integer array of length 0 < arr < 1000. The numbers in the array can be any integer positive or negative.

Output:
The lowest index N where the side to the left of N is equal to the side to the right of N. If you do not find an index that fits these rules, then you will return -1.

Note:
If you are given an array with multiple answers, return the lowest correct index.

Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

array_diff({1, 2}, 2, {1}, 1, *z) == {2} (z == 1)
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

array_diff({1, 2, 2, 2, 3}, 5, {2}, 1, *z) == {1, 3} (z == 2)

Take an integer n (n >= 0) and a digit d (0 <= d <= 9) as an integer.

Square all numbers k (0 <= k <= n) between 0 and n.

Count the numbers of digits d used in the writing of all the k**2.

Implement the function taking n and d as parameters and returning this count.

Examples:
n = 10, d = 1 
the k*k are 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100
We are using the digit 1 in: 1, 16, 81, 100. The total count is then 4.

The function, when given n = 25 and d = 1 as argument, should return 11 since
the k*k that contain the digit 1 are:
1, 16, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 361, 441.
So there are 11 digits 1 for the squares of numbers between 0 and 25.
Note that 121 has twice the digit 1.

script18.ts
Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.

Count the number of Duplicates
Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits.

Example
"abcde" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once
"aabbcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
"aabBcde" -> 2 # 'a' occurs twice and 'b' twice (`b` and `B`)
"indivisibility" -> 1 # 'i' occurs six times
"Indivisibilities" -> 2 # 'i' occurs seven times and 's' occurs twice
"aA11" -> 2 # 'a' and '1'
"ABBA" -> 2 # 'A' and 'B' each occur twice
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
script20.ts
The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.

Examples
"din"      =>  "((("
"recede"   =>  "()()()"
"Success"  =>  ")())())"
"(( @"     =>  "))(("

Assertion messages may be unclear about what they display in some languages. If you read "...It Should encode XXX", the "XXX" is the expected result, not the input!

Notes
Only positive numbers will be passed (N > 0) .
Input >> Output Examples:
1- numPrimorial (3) ==> return (30)
Explanation:
Since the passed number is (3) ,Then the primorial should obtained by multiplying 2 * 3 * 5 = 30 .

Mathematically written as , P3# = 30 .
2- numPrimorial (5) ==> return (2310)
Explanation:
Since the passed number is (5) ,Then the primorial should obtained by multiplying  2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 = 2310 .

Mathematically written as , P5# = 2310 .
3- numPrimorial (6) ==> return (30030)
Explanation:
Since the passed number is (6) ,Then the primorial should obtained by multiplying  2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 = 30030 .

Mathematically written as , P6# = 30030 .
